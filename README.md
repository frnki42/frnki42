- 👋 Hi, I’m @frnki42 because I can not name myself .frnki on GitHub and frnki was already taken.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new technical skills and I'm trying to master Cyber Security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of computer science at europe's best coding school, 42.
- :globe_with_meridians: 42.fr currently @ 42vienna.com
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I'm interested in.
- 📫 How to reach me at Discord: .frnki
- :alien: I'm absolutely new to coding, so give me some time.
