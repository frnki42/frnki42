-👋 Hey there, I’m @frnki42!
  (Fun fact: I wanted to be .frnki, but GitHub said no to dots, and plain frnki was already taken. So here we are!)

-👀 What’s the deal?
  I'm on a mission to master Cybersecurity and collect all the cool tech skills along the way. 🛡️
-🌱 Current Status:
  Learning the basics of computer science at Europe’s most epic coding school, 42. (Yes, it's named after that 42.)
-🌐 Where in the World:
  42.fr for the Paris vibe, or if you’re more into schnitzel and Strudel, check out 42 Vienna.
-💞️ Collab-o-Meter:
  Open to collaborating on anything that sparks joy, curiosity, or just makes me go "Whoa, cool!" 🔥
-📫 Paging .frnki:
  Slide into my DMs on Discord: .frnki
-👽 Warning: Newbie Alert!
  Just started coding, so if I break something… well, let’s just call it learning by doing. 🚧
